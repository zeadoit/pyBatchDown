pyBatchDown
===========
A Python-based web resource batch download script, especially fit for download conference papers :)
Actually I got this just because I want to download the NIPS'14 paper.
So this code is optimized for NIPS'14 paper page only,
which is https://sites.google.com/site/deeplearningworkshopnips2014/accepted-papers  .

If you are too lazy to write similar code for your own, and happend to see this code, just download it, then edit
it, and run it. Though, I thought that no one except for me will use this piece of code.
Anyway, it costs me some (though so little) time to write this code, so .. :)
